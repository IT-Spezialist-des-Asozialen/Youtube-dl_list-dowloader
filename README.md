# Youtube-dl_list-dowloader

This program alows you, to dowload your videos more easy. You can list them up and download them after that. Until now you can only save the video in the deafult folder. I'm trying now to allow you to use for every video another one. If you have an idea, you are allowed to help us all and suggest something.
To get this program you should download the file into the folder in where's the unzipped folder from the project is. Or you edit the path in the file.
I've wrote this code under Linux but it should work under other OS too. There you have to pay attention to the "/". In Linux and Mac OS is used a normal "/". In Windows you have to change it to a "\\".
